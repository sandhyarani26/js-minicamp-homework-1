	* Variables:It stores the values of the data type like string and name of variable written in a camelcase manner.if there are two words first letter of the second word should be  capital.For example "myname " is a variable ,it will be written as "var myName". 

	* Strings:Strings are a collection of characters enclosed inside a single or double quotes.Strings can be a single letter like 'h' ,even contain numbers like '1234'.We use quotes to signify a string.We can either use single or double quotes to represent a string.Strings represents the sentences,names,adresses,names and numbers and more.Ex:"sandhya". 

	* Functions (arguments, `return`):In a program there will be a code repeats the number of times.Instead of repeating the same steps for multiple times,we can package up those processes into reusable chunk of code called functions.Means converting a multiple lines of codes into a single code.By using these functions we can represent  repetitive functionality. 
    eg add(num1, num2) , Here add is function which adds the given numbers. where num1 and num2 are arguments.  and return the sum of two numbers.

	* `if` statements:if statement is a conditional statement and can be used for validating the given condition . If condition is true then we will execute the following statements or statemes within curly braces.

	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`):boolean variable is special type of variable where it can be only used in the situation like trur or false, on or off, 1 and 0.
